**IZ.ONE - Up**

Let's **go** up high to the end of the blue sky</p>
<p>You and I together, forever together</p>
<p>Look around, look at the world</p>
<p>The scenery where we were together are beautifully spread across</p>
<br>
<p>Let’s meet eyes and breathe heavily</p>
<p>Whoo woo whoo woo</p>
<p>Our faces are spreading without limitations across the wide sky in blue</p>
<p>Please hold me hand</p>
<br>
<p>Go up the the end of the sky</p>
<p>Go above the clouds</p>
<p>The ocean-colored scenery is wonderful, it's endlessly spread across</p>
<p>I wish the time would stop</p>
<br>
<p>To the sky, you and I</p>
<p>To the sky, we fly up</p>
<p>To the sky</p>
<p>Whether this is a reality or a dream it doesn't matter</p>
<p>To the sky</p>
<p>Go up, go up, go up</p>
<br>
<p>When the cool breeze grazes my cheeks</p>
<p>Our memories, with a smile on our face</p>
<p>Write it on the clouds so it won’t disappear</p>
<p>Whenever I want to see it, I'll be the only one to take it out and see it</p>
<br>
<p>Let's meet eyes and breathe heavily</p>
<p>Whoo woo whoo woo</p>
<p>Our faces are spreading without limitations across the wide sky in blue</p>
<p>Please hold me hand</p>
<br>
<p>Go up the the end of the sky</p>
<p>Go above the clouds</p>
<p>The ocean-colored scenery is wonderful, it's endlessly spread across</p>
<p>I wish the time would stop</p>
<br>
<p>To the sky, you and I</p>
<p>To the sky, we fly up</p>
<p>To the sky</p>
<p>Whether this is a reality or a dream it doesn't matter</p>
<p>To the sky</p>
<p>Go up, go up, go up</p>
<br>
<p>My heart that floats, you and I inside the clouds</p>
<p>Our image that reflects upon your eyes</p>
<p>I want to give every pretty thing to you</p>
<p>My love
<br>
<p>The ocean-colored scenery is wonderful, it's endlessly spread across</p>
<p>I wish the time would stop</p>
<br>
<p>To the sky, whenever it is, always remember this day</p>
<p>To the sky, let's call each others' names</p>
<p>To the sky</p>
<p>Whether this is a reality or a dream it doesn’t matter</p>
<p>To the sky</p>
<p>Go up, go up, go up</p>
